# Windows Shortcut 

This is a Java library to parse Microsoft Windows shortcuts (.lnk files).

It started out as some code in the book *Swing Hacks: Tips and Tools for Killer GUIs* and was subsequently posted as an answer on StackOverflow. Since then that answer has been edited and corrected several times. This repo tracks those modifications. 

The original question lives at https://stackoverflow.com/q/309495/675721 . More information about contributors is available in the header comments of `WindowsShortcut.java`. 

There is a [similar repository](https://github.com/DmitriiShamrikov/mslinks) which appears to be more feature-complete, and may be more useful for most people.
